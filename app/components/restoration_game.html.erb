        The world has been ravaged by drought and extreme weather. Only small pockets of life remain, surrounded by cracked, broken earth.
        It is up to you to nurture it back to health.

        <h5>How to play</h5>
        The goal is to replace the cracked earth with some sign of life, whether dirt or plants, by planting seeds and saplings in the best
        location to allow them to grow and spread onto other tiles. <br />
        Plant grass, berries, or trees by selecting one on the right and then clicking a space on the map. Grass must be planted on dirt
        and berries and trees must be planted on grass.<br />
        When a tile is next to other healthy tiles (tiles with water or plants), it will become healthier, by changing from cracked earth
        to dirt and from dirt to grass.

        Returning from the brink of extinction, life has once again covered the earth. Because of your careful stewardship, our home is whole once again.
